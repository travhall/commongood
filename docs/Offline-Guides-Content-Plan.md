## Example: Water Purification Guide (Excerpt)

```markdown
# Water Purification

**Why This Matters:** In an extended outage, clean water is your #1 priority. 
Contaminated water causes disease that's dangerous when hospitals are overwhelmed.

**What You Need:**
- Large pot or container
- Heat source (stove, fire)
- Clean storage containers
- OR: Unscented bleach (8 drops per gallon)

## Method 1: Boiling (Most Reliable)

1. Bring water to a rolling boil
2. Boil for 1 full minute (or 3 minutes above 6,500 ft elevation)
3. Let cool naturally
4. Store in clean container with lid

**Minnesota note:** At Minneapolis elevation (830 ft), 1 minute is enough.

## Method 2: Bleach Treatment

1. Add 8 drops of unscented bleach per gallon of water
2. Mix well and let sit for 30 minutes
3. Should smell slightly of chlorine (if not, repeat)
4. Safe to drink after 30 minutes

**Warning:** Only use unscented bleach (5-9% sodium hypochlorite). 
Scented or "splashless" bleach is toxic.

## Minneapolis Water Sources

**Tap water (first 48 hours):** Pressure may drop but water is treated
**Lakes (emergency only):** Purify before drinking - contains bacteria
**Wells:** Hennepin County has emergency well list (see Resource section)

## When NOT to Use Lake Water

- Near storm drains
- Visible algae bloom
- Dead fish present
- Industrial area
- In doubt? Don't drink.
